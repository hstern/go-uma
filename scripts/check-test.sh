# Race-enabled, shuffled test suite. Owned by the `test` CI job.
#
# -race: catches data races. Mandatory for CI on any concurrent or HTTP-handling
#   code.
# -shuffle=on: randomizes test order so inter-test ordering dependencies surface
#   in CI rather than as flaky local repros.
# -count=1: defeats Go's test cache. CI runs every test every time — caching
#   hides regressions when only test files change but cached output is reused.
#
# `go test ./...` walks the entire module: packages come and go as the wire
# types / client / server surfaces grow.
